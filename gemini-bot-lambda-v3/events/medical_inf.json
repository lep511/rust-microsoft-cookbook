    "medical_info":"Mr. Smith presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and significant lower extremity swelling over the past week. On arrival, he was tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. A chest X-ray demonstrated pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. He was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure and admitted to the medical ward for management.\n\nInitial treatment included intravenous furosemide boluses, supplemental oxygen via nasal prongs, and fluid restriction. By day 2, there was significant improvement in his respiratory status, with oxygen saturation improving to 94% on 2L. However, his creatinine rose from 1.2 mg/dL to 2.1 mg/dL, suggesting acute kidney injury likely secondary to diuretic therapy. Furosemide was adjusted to a lower dose, and renal function improved by day 4.\n\nOn day 3, Mr. Smith developed hyperkalemia (K+ = 5.9 mmol/L), which was managed with calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. His potassium normalized within 24 hours.\n\nDuring his stay, Mr. Smith also developed cellulitis of the left lower leg, which was confirmed by physical examination and an elevated white cell count. Cefazolin IV was initiated and continued for 5 days. The cellulitis showed marked improvement by the time of discharge.\n\nMr. Smith also experienced significant fatigue and reduced mobility during his admission. Physiotherapy was consulted, and a plan was initiated to improve his strength and endurance.\n\nBy day of discharge, Mr. Smith was feeling significantly better, ambulating with minimal assistance, and was weaned to room air."
