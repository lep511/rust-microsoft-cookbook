## OpenTelemetry in Rust
### Getting Started

The following example uses a basic hyper application. If you are not using hyper, that’s OK — you can use OpenTelemetry Rust with other HTTP implementations as well, such as Actix Web and Tide. For a complete list of libraries for supported frameworks, see the registry.

For more elaborate examples, see [examples](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/rust/examples/)

Build and run the application with the following command, then open http://localhost:8080/rolldice in your web browser to ensure it is working.
