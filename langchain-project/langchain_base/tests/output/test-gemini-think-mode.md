Here's a thought process to arrive at the correct calculation and answer:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the geometric mean of a set of fecal coliform counts and round the result to the nearest whole number for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR).

2. **Recall the Formula:**  The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n numbers. Mathematically:

   Geometric Mean = (x₁ * x₂ * ... * xₙ)^(1/n)

3. **Identify the Data:** The fecal coliform counts are 24, 15, 7, 16, 31, and 23. There are 6 data points (n = 6).

4. **Apply the Formula (Step-by-Step):**

   * **Multiply the values:** 24 * 15 * 7 * 16 * 31 * 23

   * **Calculate the product:**  Let's do this step-by-step or use a calculator efficiently.
      * 24 * 15 = 360
      * 360 * 7 = 2520
      * 2520 * 16 = 40320
      * 40320 * 31 = 1249920
      * 1249920 * 23 = 28748160

   * **Take the nth root:** We need to find the 6th root of 28,748,160. This is where a calculator with a root function is essential. Alternatively, you could use exponentiation: (28748160)^(1/6).

   * **Calculate the root:**  Using a calculator, the 6th root of 28,748,160 is approximately 17.847.

5. **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:** The question specifically states to round to the nearest whole number.

   * Look at the first decimal place: It's 8.
   * Since 8 is 5 or greater, round up the whole number.
   * Therefore, 17.847 rounds to 18.

6. **State the Final Answer:** The geometric monthly fecal coliform mean is 18.

7. **Review and Double-Check:**  Make sure all steps were performed correctly. Ensure the correct formula was used, the multiplication was accurate, the root was calculated properly, and the rounding was done according to the instructions. The context of NPDES DMR emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting.Here's how to calculate the geometric mean of the fecal coliform counts:

**1. Multiply all the values together:**

24 * 15 * 7 * 16 * 31 * 23 = 28,748,160

**2. Take the nth root of the product, where n is the number of values.**

In this case, there are 6 values, so we need to find the 6th root of 28,748,160.

Using a calculator, the 6th root of 28,748,160 is approximately 17.847.

**3. Round to the nearest whole number.**

Since the first decimal place is 8 (which is 5 or greater), we round up.

**Therefore, the geometric monthly fecal coliform mean is 18.**
