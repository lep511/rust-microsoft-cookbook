    "medical_info":"Mrs. Lee, a 72-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with progressive confusion, lethargy, and fever over 48 hours. Initial assessment revealed disorientation, neck stiffness, and a temperature of 39.2°C. Laboratory studies showed elevated white blood cell count (18,000/μL) and C-reactive protein. Lumbar puncture demonstrated cloudy cerebrospinal fluid with elevated protein, low glucose, and numerous neutrophils. She was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and immediately started on empiric therapy with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone. Blood cultures were obtained prior to antibiotic administration. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurological monitoring and management of declining mental status. On day 2, CSF cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to ceftriaxone. Vancomycin was discontinued, and ceftriaxone was continued as targeted therapy. However, Mrs. Lee developed acute kidney injury with creatinine rising from 0.9 mg/dL to 2.4 mg/dL, requiring careful fluid management and medication adjustment. By day 3, she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was controlled with levetiracetam. EEG monitoring showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Her mental status gradually improved over the next 48 hours. A moderate hearing loss was noted in her right ear, documented by audiology assessment. She also developed persistent headaches, managed with appropriate analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated to address deconditioning from prolonged bed rest. After 14 days of intravenous antibiotics, Mrs. Lee was discharged home with significantly improved mental status, though with some residual hearing deficit. Follow-up appointments were arranged with neurology and infectious disease specialists."
