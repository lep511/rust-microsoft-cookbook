Article Summary: "What Does It Really Mean to Learn?"

Joshua Rothman explores "educability" - our ability to learn over the long term and apply knowledge in unexpected contexts. Unlike AI systems that become fixed after training, humans continuously integrate diverse knowledge from various sources across time.

Computer scientist Leslie Valiant argues that educability, not just intelligence, is key to human success. It allows us to build flexible theories about the world that serve us in unanticipated circumstances. This explains why reading "Middlemarch" at 20 might only be fully understood at 40 after experiencing life.

Educability encompasses being a quick study, having common sense, and applying insights for purposes unforeseen when learning. It's valuable in doctors, politicians and others who face unpredictable challenges. Rothman considers how to enhance his own educability: learn diverse subjects, try new things, and revisit earlier knowledge.
