I need your help summarizing patient medical records for our team of doctors.
We have a series of follow-up appointments tomorrow, and the doctors need quick, insightful summaries to prepare. 

Please provide these summaries in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "name": "Patient's full name",
  "age": patient's age as an integer,
  "key_diagnoses": [
    {
      "diagnosis": "Primary diagnosis",
      "year": year of diagnosis as an integer
    },
    ...
  ],
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "Medication name",
      "purpose": "Brief description of what it's for"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "other_treatments": [
    {
      "treatment": "Treatment name",
      "purpose": "Brief description of what it's for"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "recent_concerns": [
    "Brief statement of recent health issue or concern"
  ],
  "action_items": [
    "Action item 1",
    "Action item 2",
    ...
  ]
}

Here's an example of how we'd like the summaries formatted:
