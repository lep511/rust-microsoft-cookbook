    "medical_info":"Mrs. Johnson presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and multiple episodes of vomiting over 24 hours. Initial assessment revealed marked right upper quadrant tenderness with Murphy's sign present. Her vital signs showed tachycardia (HR 112) and fever (38.5°C). Laboratory studies demonstrated elevated white blood cell count of 15,000/μL and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Ultrasound imaging confirmed the presence of gallstones with evidence of acute cholecystitis, including gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. She was admitted to the surgical ward and started on IV antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam) and IV fluids. Pain management was achieved with hydromorphone. On day 2, Mrs. Johnson developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (rate 150-160). Cardiology was consulted, and rate control was achieved with metoprolol. Her rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm within 12 hours. Due to ongoing fevers and worsening inflammatory markers, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on day 3. The procedure was complicated by minor bleeding, which was controlled intraoperatively. Post-operatively, she required additional analgesics and experienced mild ileus. By day 4, her diet was advanced as bowel function returned. However, she developed a low-grade fever and productive cough. Chest X-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate, consistent with post-operative pneumonia. She was started on additional respiratory therapy and incentive spirometry. At discharge on day 7, Mrs. Johnson was afebrile, tolerating regular diet, and ambulating independently. Her incisions were healing well, and her respiratory status had improved significantly."
